#### Project Layout ####
 indexer - Is a cmake base project that contains all the portions of the project written in C
 core - All of the python/Django based code. 
 design - All of the design documents for the project. This should not be included 
	  distrobution. 

PcapDB consists of multiple host nodes. There are two types of nodes:
  Indexer - Packet indexers capture, index, and save incoming packet streams.
  Search Head - Provides the interface for the capture system. 

In theory, on a lightly loaded system, both of these functions should be combinable. This has not yet been tested.

#### Requirements ####
PcapDB is designed to work on Linux servers only. It was developed on both Redhat Enterprise and Debian systems, but its primary testbed has so far been Redhat based.

sys_requirements.txt contains a list of the packages required to run and build pcapdb

requirements.txt contains python/pip requirements. They can will be installed via 
'make install'.

#### Deployment ####
For development, you can simply work with pcapdb mostly in place. To set up its
directory structure, run 'make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)'.

For actual deployment, simply run 'make install' (See README).

#### Interface ####
See the README in core/ for more information about the organization and setup of the interface.
