#### Building PF-ring ZC Drivers ####
You can get pfring packages straight from ntop via their mirrors for certain systems/kernels. This
is generally preferable for the main components of the package. To use PFRING in ZC mode, which is
greatly preferred, you'll need drivers specific to your network card and kernel.

To build the drivers you'll need the following:
bison 
flex 
kernel-headers
kernel-devel

Within the pfring source, run make and make install in:
 - drivers/ZC/intel/<your_card's_driver>

You should also ensure your card's driver isn't overwritten by another package automatically. RHEL has kmod-<driver> packages that should be removed, for instance.
